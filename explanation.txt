  RevHistToATF.py looks over the scrapped revision history web pages, and combines
them into an ATF formatted file.

    AtfToLemmaList.py provides two functions.  First it goes over an ATF file and
tries to make as many associations as it can between individual lemmata and the
token in the text it represents, based on the position of the token in the line.
Then it creates two output files.  The first is a list of the text part of each
text-lemmata pair, in a format close enough to ATF for SNER to operate on it, and
with the line on which each token was placed recorded.  The second is a tab separated
CSV file, each line containing a text-lemmmata pair, and the line on which it was
placed in the first file.

SNER is then run on the generated ATF-esque file
(See 490-DataParser/SnerInstructions.txt for necessary modifications)

  Finally LemCompareV2.py looks at each text-lemmata pair in the second file
from AtfToLemmaList.py and looks up how SNER classified that text item using the
prediction output files from SNER (target_atf.KEY and atf_prediction.RT). It is
easy to find the prediction for a particular token, since each is on its own line
in the ATF, and SNER records the line it got each token from in the target_atf.KEY
file.  The script outputs counts for how many tokens SNER classified correctly
and incorrectly.
